# Fluids

## FluidSimulations
*FluidSimulations* - it is header-only c++11 library wich implements some of the methods of fluid simulations
from [ Bridson R. Fluid simulation for computer graphics - 2009 ]

At the current state this library requires a lot of work to do. First of all it requires optimization, 
because it can take a lot of time to simulate even simplest system. Secondly careful debuging facilities
should be implemented and all possible bugs should be corrected. And of course this library touches only
the tip of the iceberg of fluid simulations - there are plenty other worthwhile methods.

You are welcome to submit :)
